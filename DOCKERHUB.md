# GitLab Flow for Docker Image Building & Deployment

## 1. Purpose

This Docker image is designed to simplify and streamline the process of building and deploying applications stored in a GitLab repository. It serves the following purposes:
- `AMS Attribute Configuration`: The image helps in setting up attributes for the AMS (Attributes of Microservices) as part of the build and deployment process. This ensures that microservices follow a consistent set of standards and configurations, optimizing their performance and scalability.
- `Artifact Management`: It assists in generating and managing build artifacts, ensuring the build process is standardized and repeatable. By doing so, it eliminates discrepancies between different environments, reducing errors during deployment.
- `Unified Docker Image Packaging`: The image ensures consistency by packaging the application into Docker images. This makes it easier to deploy in different environments, ensuring that all instances of the application are identical and free from configuration drift.
- `Docker Image Validation`: Validates the Docker images to ensure they meet necessary quality and security requirements. This step is crucial in maintaining security and preventing vulnerabilities from being deployed into production.
- `Kubernetes-Based Deployment`: The image facilitates deployment on Kubernetes-based application servers. This ensures smooth integration with cloud-native environments and takes full advantage of Kubernetes' orchestration capabilities.
- `Deployment Validation`: Validates the deployment process to ensure successful and consistent application rollout. It helps in identifying any potential issues during deployment before they impact end-users, thereby reducing downtime and improving system reliability.

Additionally, this image contributes to automating many steps in the CI/CD pipeline, reducing manual errors and improving the efficiency of software development and deployment processes.
